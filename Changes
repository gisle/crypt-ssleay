   Release 0.07

   Applied patch from Andreas Gustafsson <gson@araneus.fi> which
   make this module compile on WinNT with ActivePerl and MS Visual C++.
   For others that try to build on this platform, Andreas also said:

      "In addition to making these source changes, I also had to
      resort to editing the MakeMaker-generated makefile by hand to
      fix various library paths.  Unfortunately, I am not familiar
      enough with either MakeMaker or NT to provide a clean fix for
      this problem."
