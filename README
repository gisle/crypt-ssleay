Crypt::SSLeay
-------------

This is an Perl interface to the SSLeay library by Eric Young.  SSLeay
is a free implementation of Netscape's SSL protocol.  You can get more
information about SSLeay and SSL from these places:

  http://www.psy.uq.oz.au/~ftp/Crypt
  ftp://ftp.psy.uq.oz.au/pub/Crypto/SSL/
  http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/SSL.html

The modules in this package are meant to replace the Net::SSLeay
module by Sampo Kellomaki which as far as I can see is not maintained
any more.  I have not been able to reach Sampo on his mail addresses.
I changed the module name because I did not want to stay completely
compatible with Sampo's interfaces.

The main motivation for doing this is to improve the SSL support in
libwww-perl.  Using the old Net::SSLeay module LWP was able to talk to
HTTPS servers, but you could not examine the ciphers used, the
server certificates or use client certificates.

The following modules are available:

   Crypt::SSLeay

   Crypt::SSLeay::CTX
   Crypt::SSLeay::Conn
   Crypt::SSLeay::X509

   Crypt::SSLeay::Context

   Net::SSL

The Net::SSL module is a IO::Socket::INET subclass that makes use of
the SSL protocol mostly transparent.



INSTALLATION

You must first install SSLeay-0.6.6.  The 0.8.X versions of SSLeay
does not really work yet.  Once this is accomplished you just perform
the usual steps:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
